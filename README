DESCRIPTION
    This module allows adding syntax highlighter hints to a Pod document to
    be rendered as XHTML. Normally, verbatim blocks will be represented
    inside "<pre><code>...</code></pre>" tags. The information will be
    represented as class names and data attributes on those tags.

    Configuration values effect all verbatim blocks until the next
    highlighter configuration directive.

CONFIGURATION
    The configuration must be specified in a "=for highlighter" block, as a
    whitespace separated list of settings. Each setting must be in the form
    "<key>=<value>". Alternately, a bare option without an "=" can be used
    to specify the language setting.

    language
        This is the language to highlight the verbatim blocks with. It will
        be represented as a "language-$language" class on the "<code>" tag.

    line_numbers
        A true or false value indicating if line numbers should be included.
        If true, it will be represented as a "line-numbers" class on the
        "<pre>" block.

    start_line
        A number for what to start numbering lines as rather than starting
        at 1. Only valid when the "line_numbers" option is enabled. It will
        be represented as a "data-start" attribute on the "<pre>" block.

    highlight
        A comma separated list of lines or line ranges to highlight, such as
        5, "4-10", or "1,4-6,10-14". It will be represented as a "data-line"
        attribute on the "<pre>" block.
